# GoWiki

This is main wiki page.  Modify this page so that it provides an overview of what this wiki contains.  This wiki is an expansion of the wiki built in the [Golang Web Application Tutorial](http://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/)

## Adding New Pages

Simply link or navigate in your browser to a new page which has the name you desire.  For example, this is a link to a page call [NewPage](/view/NewPage)

## Modifying Pages

When you modify pages, it is saved as a new version.  This allows you to view all previous versions and edit old versions to set them as the current version again.  See the version information on the bottom of this page as an example of how this works.

## Format Your Pages With Markdown

You can add headings and many other things (like code blocks) using [markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics).

## Automatic Table of Contents

When you use markdown to add headings to your wiki pages, they are automatically
put into a table of contents when the page is viewed to allow easy navigation of well structured pages.

## This Is A Toy

There is no security at all on this wiki, so anyone can edit and there is no record of who changed what.  Use at your own risk.
